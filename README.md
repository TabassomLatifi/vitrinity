# Vitrinity
Vitrinity is a website that classified goods on social networks such as instagram. As searching specific products based on various criteria is not easy on instagram, customer can search on Vitrinity easier and after deciding what s/he wants to buy, s/he'll be linked to the store page on instagram or online shop website and will be able to place an order. 
I've used vanialla java script, html and css. 
the website doesn't link to an API and also doesn't have a back-end yet.
